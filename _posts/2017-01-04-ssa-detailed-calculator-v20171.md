The SSA released [version 2017.1](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html) of the Detailed Calculator on December 22, with a CFM PowerPC binary and source code.

I've incorporated the changes [into my github repo](https://github.com/bslabs/anypiamac/commit/888f76408dd3cd11697f2e5898b54f29faabeb78), and posted a Universal Binary [at github](https://github.com/bslabs/anypiamac/releases/tag/2017.1).
The release now includes documentation and (converted) sample .pia files.
