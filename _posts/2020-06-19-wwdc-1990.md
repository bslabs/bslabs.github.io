Although circumstances have unfortunately forced the upcoming 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference to be online-only, I thought it would be fun to look back 30 years to WWDC 1990, the second conference held (and the first for which a CD was published).

On May 7-11, 1990, Apple Computer held the second-ever Worldwide Developers Conference at the (then-new) San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, CA. A [newsgroup post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.sys.mac.programmer/rVqacSYdaZs/N4FqvMmpZu4J) indicates that the attendance fee was $195 per day, and hotels were available for $56-135 a night.

For some historical context, Macintosh [System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7) was introduced a year earlier at the 1989 WWDC, and would be publicly released a year later in May 1991. It was a major focus of the conference.

[A/UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX) 2.0 had previously been announced, and was [released soon after in June 1990](https://tech-insider.org/mac/research/1990/0515.html).
The "wicked fast" [Macintosh IIfx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIfx) had also been released in the spring of 1990.
[Apple IIGS System 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_GS/OS) had been released in 1989, and there were several Apple IIGS-related sessions.

Also interesting: [Microsoft Windows 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0), considered by most to be the first usable version of Windows, was released a few days later on May 22.

[TidBITS](https://tidbits.com/1990/05/14/developers-conference/) and [InfoWorld](https://books.google.com/books?id=MDsEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&lr&rview=1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) both covered the event at the time.

<!--The 1990 WWDC does have an interesting wrinkle, stop me if this sounds familiar. Apple is juggling multiple platforms: one of which built the company into its current success, is still popular and selling well, and has die-hard users clamoring for more attention. The other is the new kid on the block, with its own die-hard user base dedicated to the platform for its ease-of-use and growing capabilities. Apple claims to love and support both platforms equally, but it's clear that most effort is going to the new kid. Of course I'm talking about the Apple II (particularly the IIgs) and the Macintosh, and the 1990 WWDC had an entire day of talks dedicated to software development for the IIgs.-->

I have to admit, I'm burying the lede a bit: this year on eBay I found a **23-minute-long, Apple-produced VHS tape of the conference**.
<img src="/assets/posts/wwdc-1990/vhs.jpg" alt="WWDC 1990 VHS tape"/>

It's not technical at all: the first half is just B-roll of attendees and the convention center, and the second half is a cringey walk-around of the conference.
<br>This video is peak **weird-90s-Apple**. Just watch it.
<br>Big thanks to [David Greelish](https://twitter.com/davidgreelish) for capturing the VHS tape! He's working on [a documentary about the Apple Lisa](https://theapplelisafilm.com) that looks fantastic, you can [pre-buy it now](https://www.gofundme.com/f/before-macintosh-the-apple-lisa-documentary-film).

[**WWDC - The Movie / WWDC - The Real Story**](https://youtu.be/2bewvHiWLYA)  

Now that the video has transported you to San Jose in 1990, it's time for the presentations!

<img src="/assets/posts/wwdc-1990/cd_screenshot.png" alt="WWDC 1990 Presentations HyperCard stack"/>

The conference disc was Volume 3 1/2 of Apple's then-new Developer CD series, and included the slides of all presentations as well as two HyperCard stacks: [one serving as an overall catalog/launcher of the presentations](https://archive.org/details/hypercard_wwdc-1990-conference-stack), and another holding a full directory of all 2154 attendees.

It can be downloaded (in the inconvenient MDF/MDS format) from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/download/Apple_Developer_Discs_1989-2009/1990/ADC%20Developer%20CD%20%28Volume%2003%2C5%20-%20%27%27WWDC%201990%27%27%29_mdf.rar), or [from my server](//static.bslabs.net/wwdc/1990/1990 WWDC CD.cdr) in .cdr. In addition the presentations were originally created with PowerPoint 2.0, I converted them into PDF using PowerPoint 2.0 and Adobe Acrobat PDFWriter 3.0 running under OS X 10.4.

I only recognized one presenter who is still a household name for Apple enthusiasts: one **Philip Schiller**, credited as a "Multimedia Specialist".
<br>The sessions cover a wide range of topics: the Mac and System 7, A/UX, the Apple IIGS, networking, development tools, hardware, business/marketing, and more. Enjoy!

- [2 for 1: Parallel Development](//static.bslabs.net/wwdc/1990/2 for 1 Parallel Development.pdf)
<br>An exploration into parallel development on the GS and Macintosh.
<br>The presentation and sample code provided is designed to give you an introduction to an easy way to broaden the market for your applications.  The GS and Macintosh toolboxes are, from a programmer's standpoint, very similar.  By understanding and taking advantage of the similarities you can design your applications to run on both platforms with minimal source code changes.
<br>Two applications from one set of source code is the goal. The reduction in programming time, debugging time, and testing time will more than pay for itself.
<br>The presentation here covers the thought process involved, and touches on areas in the toolboxes that need special consideration or handling.
<br>The [sample code](https://github.com/bslabs/parallel-mac-gs) is a simple game that shows some basic parallel programming techniques and considerations. It contains the code and a build script that will let you build both the Mac and GS versions. The sample code demonstrates menus, windows, dialogs, printing, event handling, sound, and QuickDraw, all the features that a well-tempered application needs.
<!--	The sample code is designed to run under MPW, and uses MPW C and MPW CIIGS. You will not be able to launch these samples from this stack. We recommend that you access the sample code from the Finder (in the Demof folder) copy it down to your local hard drive, and take it from there! Examine the source, compile it and play with the results.  Then make changes that apply to the application you're writing, and see how the process of creating applications for two machines from a single source file can be handled with less additional time than porting or 'from scratch' on both machines. Take the shell I've written here, and add at least 700,000 additional potential buyers to your next release!-->
