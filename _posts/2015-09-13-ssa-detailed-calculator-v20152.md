The SSA released [version 2015.2](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html) of the Detailed Calculator on September 4, with a PowerPC binary and source code.

I incorporated the changes [into my github repo](https://github.com/bslabs/anypiamac/commit/8c0fe1e58c14c1f98f04d70be5d34d36439a642b), and posted a Universal Binary [at github](https://github.com/bslabs/anypiamac/releases/tag/2015.2).

Unfortunately I still haven't been able to get a reply from anyone at the Social Security Administration regarding the Detailed Calculator and this work. Thanks to David Oster [for his previous work and kind words](https://plus.google.com/+DavidOster/posts/WnyBgPh177o)
