I really enjoyed the reactions and feedback to [the last post](/2017/06/01/wwdc-1997/), and even heard from several presenters!
I'm still on the lookout for slides/videos from WWDC 1998/1999, if you have any information please [contact me!](https://twitter.com/RealMrPippy)

A few months after my last post, I spotted a WWDC 97 CD *set* on eBay. I had included a picture of it in the last post, but thought it was just the CD that the slides had come from.

As it turns out, this is a 5 CD set containing **session videos** from the conference! The videos are in RealMedia format at very low bitrates/quality, allowing for 20 sessions across the 5 CDs.

If you liked the slides, you'll find the videos *fascinating*. In particular, the overview/strategy speakers take pains to emphasize what has changed since the year before: developing rather than abandoning the Mac OS, promising to ship regular incremental improvements, and moving ahead with a next-generation OS (Rhapsody) built on shipping, proven technology.

Some highlights:

- [Session 500: Hardware Roadmap](#500) includes a 7 minute talk by industrial design director **Jonathan Ive** (starting at minute 32), who takes the wraps off a new product. I think he's still at Apple, does anyone know?
- [Session 204: Mac OS Support in Rhapsodyâ€™s Blue Box](#204) shows the Blue Box (which would become the [Classic Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/List_of_macOS_components#Classic)) in an already quite functional state. The Blue Box was actually demoed running on both Copland (the original development target) and Rhapsody, making this probably the only session where Copland was still being shown.
- Many sessions include substantial (20+ minute) Q&A sessions at the end, which are fascinating to watch. In particular, the Q&A for [Session 101: Core OS Changes](#101) is a potpourri of esoteric Mac development questions and jokes (i.e. about the classic Mac "printing architecture").


Session descriptions are below each video link, and my notes are in italics.
